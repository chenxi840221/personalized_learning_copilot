# Learning Plan Content Updates

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to ensure that all activities in created learning plans have recommended external educational resources.

## Implementation Details

### Changes to `/backend/api/learning_plan_routes.py`

1. **Standard Learning Plan Creation** (POST `/learning-plans/`):
   - Modified to request more content items (`k=15`) during retrieval
   - Added logic to process activity dictionaries and ensure each has content references
   - Implemented content assignment for activities without content references by:
     - Tracking used content IDs to avoid duplicates when possible
     - Using available unused content items
     - Falling back to reusing items when necessary
   - Enhanced metadata with detailed content information:
     - Title, description, and subject
     - Difficulty level and content type
     - Grade level and URL
   - Added improved learning benefit descriptions that reference the content

2. **Profile-Based Learning Plan Creation** (POST `/learning-plans/profile-based`):
   - Updated both the "balanced" and "single subject" plan paths
   - Enhanced content assignment to ensure all activities have associated educational resources
   - Improved content metadata with detailed information
   - Added better learning benefit descriptions
   - Increased the number of content items retrieved (`k=10`) to ensure sufficient content

3. **Content Assignment Logic**:
   ```python
   # If the activity doesn't have a content reference, assign one from available content
   if not content_id and relevant_content:
       # Pick a content item that hasn't been used yet
       used_content_ids = [a.get("content_id") for a in plan_dict.get("activities", []) if a.get("content_id")]
       unused_content = [c for c in relevant_content if str(c.id) not in used_content_ids]
       
       if unused_content:
           # Use the first unused content
           matching_content = unused_content[0]
           content_id = str(matching_content.id)
           content_url = matching_content.url
       elif relevant_content:
           # If all content has been used, reuse the first item
           matching_content = relevant_content[0]
           content_id = str(matching_content.id)
           content_url = matching_content.url
   ```

4. **Metadata Enhancement Logic**:
   ```python
   # Prepare content metadata with detailed information about the educational resource
   content_metadata = {"subject": subject}
   if matching_content:
       content_info = {
           "title": matching_content.title,
           "description": matching_content.description,
           "subject": matching_content.subject,
           "difficulty_level": matching_content.difficulty_level.value if hasattr(matching_content, "difficulty_level") else None,
           "content_type": matching_content.content_type.value if hasattr(matching_content, "content_type") else None,
           "grade_level": matching_content.grade_level if hasattr(matching_content, "grade_level") else None,
           "url": matching_content.url
       }
       content_metadata["content_info"] = content_info
   ```

## Testing

A test script (`scripts/test_learning_plan_content.py`) was created to verify that all activities in generated learning plans have content references. The script checks:

1. Total number of activities
2. Number of activities with content references
3. Content information for each activity

## Benefits

These updates ensure that:

1. Every learning plan activity has associated educational content
2. Content is distributed efficiently among activities to avoid duplication when possible
3. Detailed content information is available to the frontend for display
4. Learning benefits are tailored to explain the value of the educational resources

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the future:

1. Improve content-to-activity matching based on topic relevance
2. Enhance content variety by considering previously used content in user history
3. Add content recommendation quality metrics and feedback loops
4. Integrate content difficulty progression in multi-activity sequences
