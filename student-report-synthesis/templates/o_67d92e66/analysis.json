They learn to listen for rhyme, letter patterns and sounds in words, to recognise the letters of the English alphabet and to use the most common sounds represented by letters. Children begin to build visual memory of common high-frequency words and learn to orally blend and segment phonemes in single-syllable words. Literacy workshops also provide many opportunities for children to express their ideas using drawings, written print and oral description.",

Students explore patterns by copying, continuing and creating patterns with objects and drawings. Kindergarten children learn to recognise and name shapes in the environment. They learn to explain the order and duration of events using the everyday language of time, and sequence and connect familiar events to the time of day.",

She recalls events from texts with familiar topics and uses predicting and questioning strategies to explore meaning in texts. Olivia is developing early literacy skills, including listening for rhyme, letter patterns and sounds in words, recognising the letters of the English alphabet and using the most common sounds represented by letters. Olivia has been building visual memory of a small bank of high-frequency words and is learning to blend sounds when reading simple words. Since the beginning of the year, Olivia has made particular progress in applying her letter and sound knowledge to her reading and writing. A current goal for Olivia is to continue to build her sight word memory of high- frequency words and to correctly spell high- frequency words in her writing.",

She is developing fluency when saying short number word sequences, forwards and backwards. Olivia is learning to identify numerals by reading, writing and ordering written numbers. She can count visible items, such as counters, in collections and rows. Olivia can copy, continue and create patterns with objects and drawings and has been learning to represent location using diagrams and simple maps. She uses detailed instructions in describing position and movement. Olivia exhibits proficiency in sorting and classifying objects according to common characteristics and explains the basis for these groupings. She demonstrates a positive approach to mathematical tasks and is persistent when faced with a challenge. Olivia uses the counting on and counting back strategy to solve addition and subtraction problems. She has instant recall of number combinations that add to 10. Olivia has made progress in connecting number names, numerals and quantities to 100. A current learning goal is to focus on the place value of two-digit and three-digit numbers and the sequencing of number patterns by using a number line. When ordering two-digit and three-digit numbers the focus is on the mathematical language of least and greatest value.",

She collaborates with clearly defined ideas and builds with strong purpose and commitment. Olivia enjoys expressing her imagination and creativity through visual art. She uses personal experience and observation to create detailed and thoughtful visual artworks and designs which she shares with others. During our geography unit, Olivia understood that places can be represented on maps and models. She enjoyed using and making maps to navigate around the school and correctly demonstrated how to read features of a map. Olivia has shown particular interest in Footsteps dance sessions and she confidently performs dance movements to successfully communicate ideas and feelings.",
